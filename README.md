# Federated-Flask
This project demonstrates the implementation of the FedAvg algorithm in a Flask-based web application. FedAvg is a federated learning technique that enables training machine learning models with data distributed across multiple clients, without the need to share sensitive data centrally.

## Description
- Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning approach where clients (user devices or edge devices) participate in model training locally, without sharing their raw data with a central server.
- Instead, only model updates, are shared. The central server aggregates these updates to create a global model, which is then sent back to the clients for further training.
- This process is repeated iteratively until the model converges or reaches a desired level of performance.training machine learning models with data distributed across multiple clients, without the need to share sensitive data centrally.
